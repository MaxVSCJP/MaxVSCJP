Hi, I'm Maassas!
- I know, weird name (has Mass & ass in it) I am open to taking questions about it.

I am still a student learning to be a developer.
I currently code in:
  - Javascript
  - Python &
  - Java

Currently I'm learing Backend development with Express.js and MongoDB.

I'd like to collaborate on any projects I am able to help with and add value to as I'd like to learn as much as I can before guys like Devin take over.

You can reach me on my 
  - [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maassas-t-145470282/)
  - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/masesem7/)
  - [Twitter](https://x.com/MasesEm07)
  - [Telegram](https://t.me/Maxdout)

Fun Fact: I can get obsessed over things too easily, more easily than is normal. 
  - Find a bug that's hard to solve? Well there goes my afternoon, and possibly weekend.
  - Friend run into a problem and asked me to solve it/help solve it, then turns out to be a hard problem to solve? That's not their problem anymore.



P.S My pronouns are My liege/Maassas-sensei
